# Solidity API

## IDelayedService

Specifically, this interface is designed for services that consult stake amounts up to `BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE`
blocks in the past. This may be necessary due to, e.g., network processing & communication delays, or to avoid race conditions
that could be present with coordinating aggregate operator signatures while service operators are registering & de-registering.

_To clarify edge cases, the middleware can look `BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE` blocks into the past, i.e. it may trust stakes from the interval
[block.number - BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE, block.number] (specifically, *inclusive* of the block that is `BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE` before the current one)_

### BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE

```solidity
function BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE() external view returns (uint32)
```

The maximum amount of blocks in the past that the service will consider stake amounts to still be 'valid'.
