# Solidity API

## IEigenPod

The main functionalities are:
- creating new ETH validators with their withdrawal credentials pointed to this contract
- proving from beacon chain state roots that withdrawal credentials are pointed to this contract
- proving from beacon chain state roots the balances of ETH validators with their withdrawal credentials
  pointed to this contract
- updating aggregate balances in the EigenPodManager
- withdrawing eth when withdrawals are initiated

_Note that all beacon chain balances are stored as gwei within the beacon chain datastructures. We choose
  to account balances in terms of gwei in the EigenPod contract and convert to wei when making calls to other contracts_

### VALIDATOR_STATUS

```solidity
enum VALIDATOR_STATUS {
  INACTIVE,
  ACTIVE,
  OVERCOMMITTED,
  WITHDRAWN
}
```

### PartialWithdrawalClaim

```solidity
struct PartialWithdrawalClaim {
  enum IEigenPod.PARTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_CLAIM_STATUS status;
  uint32 creationBlockNumber;
  uint32 fraudproofPeriodEndBlockNumber;
  uint64 partialWithdrawalAmountGwei;
}
```

### PARTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_CLAIM_STATUS

```solidity
enum PARTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_CLAIM_STATUS {
  REDEEMED,
  PENDING,
  FAILED
}
```

### REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI

```solidity
function REQUIRED_BALANCE_GWEI() external view returns (uint64)
```

The amount of eth, in gwei, that is restaked per validator

### REQUIRED_BALANCE_WEI

```solidity
function REQUIRED_BALANCE_WEI() external view returns (uint256)
```

The amount of eth, in wei, that is restaked per validator

### validatorStatus

```solidity
function validatorStatus(uint40 validatorIndex) external view returns (enum IEigenPod.VALIDATOR_STATUS)
```

this is a mapping of validator indices to a Validator struct containing pertinent info about the validator

### restakedExecutionLayerGwei

```solidity
function restakedExecutionLayerGwei() external view returns (uint64)
```

the amount of execution layer ETH in this contract that is staked in EigenLayer (i.e. withdrawn from beaconchain but not EigenLayer),

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address owner) external
```

Used to initialize the pointers to contracts crucial to the pod's functionality, in beacon proxy construction from EigenPodManager

### stake

```solidity
function stake(bytes pubkey, bytes signature, bytes32 depositDataRoot) external payable
```

Called by EigenPodManager when the owner wants to create another ETH validator.

### withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH

```solidity
function withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) external
```

Transfers `amountWei` in ether from this contract to the specified `recipient` address
Called by EigenPodManager to withdrawBeaconChainETH that has been added to the EigenPod's balance due to a withdrawal from the beacon chain.

_Called during withdrawal or slashing.
Note that this function is marked as non-reentrant to prevent the recipient calling back into it_

### eigenPodManager

```solidity
function eigenPodManager() external view returns (contract IEigenPodManager)
```

The single EigenPodManager for EigenLayer

### podOwner

```solidity
function podOwner() external view returns (address)
```

The owner of this EigenPod

### hasRestaked

```solidity
function hasRestaked() external view returns (bool)
```

an indicator of whether or not the podOwner has ever "fully restaked" by successfully calling `verifyCorrectWithdrawalCredentials`.

### mostRecentWithdrawalBlockNumber

```solidity
function mostRecentWithdrawalBlockNumber() external view returns (uint64)
```

block number of the most recent withdrawal

### provenPartialWithdrawal

```solidity
function provenPartialWithdrawal(uint40 validatorIndex, uint64 slot) external view returns (bool)
```

mapping that tracks proven partial withdrawals

### verifyWithdrawalCredentials

```solidity
function verifyWithdrawalCredentials(uint64 oracleBlockNumber, uint40 validatorIndex, struct BeaconChainProofs.ValidatorFieldsAndBalanceProofs proofs, bytes32[] validatorFields) external
```

This function verifies that the withdrawal credentials of the podOwner are pointed to
this contract. It also verifies the current (not effective) balance  of the validator.  It verifies the provided proof of the ETH validator against the beacon chain state
root, marks the validator as 'active' in EigenLayer, and credits the restaked ETH in Eigenlayer.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| oracleBlockNumber | uint64 | is the Beacon Chain blockNumber whose state root the `proof` will be proven against. |
| validatorIndex | uint40 | is the index of the validator being proven, refer to consensus specs |
| proofs | struct BeaconChainProofs.ValidatorFieldsAndBalanceProofs | is the bytes that prove the ETH validator's balance and withdrawal credentials against a beacon chain state root |
| validatorFields | bytes32[] | are the fields of the "Validator Container", refer to consensus specs  for details: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#validator |

### verifyOvercommittedStake

```solidity
function verifyOvercommittedStake(uint40 validatorIndex, struct BeaconChainProofs.ValidatorFieldsAndBalanceProofs proofs, bytes32[] validatorFields, uint256 beaconChainETHStrategyIndex, uint64 oracleBlockNumber) external
```

This function records an overcommitment of stake to EigenLayer on behalf of a certain ETH validator.
        If successful, the overcommitted balance is penalized (available for withdrawal whenever the pod's balance allows).
        The ETH validator's shares in the enshrined beaconChainETH strategy are also removed from the StrategyManager and undelegated.

_For more details on the Beacon Chain spec, see: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#validator_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| validatorIndex | uint40 | is the index of the validator being proven, refer to consensus specs |
| proofs | struct BeaconChainProofs.ValidatorFieldsAndBalanceProofs | is the proof of the validator's balance and validatorFields in the balance tree and the balanceRoot to prove for |
| validatorFields | bytes32[] | are the fields of the "Validator Container", refer to consensus specs |
| beaconChainETHStrategyIndex | uint256 | is the index of the beaconChainETHStrategy for the pod owner for the callback to                                     the StrategyManager in case it must be removed from the list of the podOwners strategies |
| oracleBlockNumber | uint64 | The oracleBlockNumber whose state root the `proof` will be proven against.        Must be within `VERIFY_OVERCOMMITTED_WINDOW_BLOCKS` of the current block. |

### verifyAndProcessWithdrawal

```solidity
function verifyAndProcessWithdrawal(struct BeaconChainProofs.WithdrawalProofs withdrawalProofs, bytes validatorFieldsProof, bytes32[] validatorFields, bytes32[] withdrawalFields, uint256 beaconChainETHStrategyIndex, uint64 oracleBlockNumber) external
```

This function records a full withdrawal on behalf of one of the Ethereum validators for this EigenPod

#### Parameters

| withdrawalFields | bytes32[] | are the fields of the withdrawal being proven |
| beaconChainETHStrategyIndex | uint256 | is the index of the beaconChainETHStrategy for the pod owner for the callback to         the EigenPodManager to the StrategyManager in case it must be removed from the podOwner's list of strategies |
| oracleBlockNumber | uint64 |  |

### withdrawBeforeRestaking

```solidity
function withdrawBeforeRestaking() external
```

Called by the pod owner to withdraw the balance of the pod when `hasRestaked` is set to false
