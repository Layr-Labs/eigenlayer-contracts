### slashOperator

Called by an AVS to slash an operator for a given array of strategies, the corresponding operatorSet to slash from, and the `bipsToSlash`. The bips are with respect to the slashable stake allocation that has been set for the operatorSet, operator, and strategy e.g. `bipsToIncrease = 5000`  leads to half of the slashable stake that has been allocated the operatorSet on behalf of the operator being slashed.

For accounting reasons, this function also reduces the magnitude of the slashing operatorSet in the future and pending deallocations from the operatorSet in order maintain pending nominal stake guarantees in future forecasts. Overall, the total magnitude for the (operator, strategy) before the request is greater than the total magnitude after. 

Emits an
1. `OperatorSlashed` event
2. `MagnitudeAllocation` event for each strategy that has been slashed for the operatorSet, to overwrite previously expected allocations in indexers
3. `MagnitudeDeallocation` event for each strategy that has been slashed for the operatorSet, to overwrite previously expected deallocations in indexers

Reverts if:

1. `bipsToSlash == 0 || bipsToSlash > 10000`
2. `operator` is not registered or within 17.5 days of deregistering from an operatorSet

### getMinimumSlashableSharesBefore

Fetches the minimum slashable shares for a certain operator and operatorSet for a list of strategies from the current timestamp until the given timestamp. This called by AVSs to forecast their slashable stake over a slashability window.

Reverts if:

1. `timestamp` is more than 17.5 days in the future. Since the withdrawal period is 17.5 days, longer intervals cannot be forecasted.
