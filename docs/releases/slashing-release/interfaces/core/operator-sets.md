### createOperatorSets

This is called by an AVS to create a group of operatorSets.

Reverts if:

1. OperatorSets with the any of the given `operatorSetIds` already exist

### registerOperatorToAVS - M2 Legacy

This is called by AVSs when operators initially register for their AVS. It requires a [EIP 1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature from the operator. This is used in legacy M2 AVSs. Once the AVS begins migrating to operatorSet based registration, it can no longer use the legacy functions. 

Reverts if:

1. The `operatorSignature` is not from `operator`
2. If `operator` is not registered with the DelegationManager
3. If `operator` is already registered with the AVS
4. The AVS is an operatorSet AVS.

### deregisterOperatorFromAVS - M2 Legacy

This is called by AVSs when operators deregister from their AVS. This is used in legacy M2 AVSs.

Reverts if:

1. the operator is not registered for the AVS

### registerOperatorToOperatorSets

This is called by AVSs that have integrated with operatorSets in order to add an operator to a specified list of operatorSets. A signature from the operator is required.

Emits a `OperatorAddedToOperatorSet` event for each operatorSet the operator is added to.

Reverts if:

1. Any of the operatorSets don't exist
2. `operator` is not registered with the DelegationManager
3. `operator` is already registered for any of the operatorSets
4. `operatorSignature` is not from the `operator`

### migrateOperatorsToOperatorSets

This is called by an AVS to migrate its M2 legacy registered operators to a list of operator sets. This function can only be called once for a given operator that is already registered to the AVS. No consent is required by the operator. If the operator disagrees with the migration, it can unilaterally remove itself from any operatorSet. The operator is deregistered from legacy M2 registration once this function is called - the `OperatorAVSRegistrationStatus` with the UNREGISTERED parameter is emitted. 

Emits a `OperatorAddedToOperatorSet` event for each operatorSet the operator is added to. Also emits an `OperatorMigratedToOperatorSets` for all operatorSets the operator is migrated to. 

Reverts If:
1. The operator does not have a legacy M2 registration with the AVS
2. The operator has already been migrated
3. Any of the target operatorSets have not been created
4. The operator has already been registered for any of the operatorSets


### deregisterOperatorFromOperatorSets

This is called by AVSs that have integrated with operatorSets in order to removed an operator from a list of operatorSets.

Emits a `OperatorRemovedFromOperatorSet` event for each operatorSet the operator is removed from.

Reverts if:

1. `operator` is not registered for at least one of the operatorSets

### forceDeregisterFromOperatorSets

This is called by operator or on their behalf (using a signature) in order to deregister from a list of operatorSets of a given AVS. This is intended to be used in cases where AVS contracts are compromised and don't allow operators to deregister. There is no risk from staying registered, but the functionality is included for aesthetic reasons.

AVSs must update to force deregistrations asynchronously through through their own means (e.g. AVSSync).

Reverts if:

1. `msg.sender` is not the `operator` or `operatorSignature` is not from `operator`
2. `operator` is not registered for at least one of the operatorSets

### doesOperatorSetExist

Returns whether an operatorSet has been created.

### isOperatorInOperatorSet

Returns whether an operator is in an operatorSet.
