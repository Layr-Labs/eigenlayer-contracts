Otherwise at least add a summary and description.

- [ ] Get PR reviewed
- [ ] Respond to review / make any further changes
- [ ] Create ticket for tests

### Blocking Issues
Is anything blocking for this? (Do we need to design and/or build something first?)
Please link blocking issues here. If something is blocking and doesn't have an issue yet, create it!

### Don't Forget To
* Assign this to a project (our default is [eigenlayer](https://github.com/orgs/Layr-Labs/projects/3/))
* Add priority + size estimate
* Set status to New
