LEGAL STATE TRANSITIONS:
1)
FROM not delegated -- defined as delegatedTo(staker) == address(0), likewise returned by !isDelegated(staker)--
AND not registered as an operator -- defined as isOperator(operator) == false, or equivalently, delegationTerms(operator) == 0,
TO delegated but not an operator
in this case, the end state is that:
isOperator(staker) == false,
delegatedTo(staker) != staker && delegatedTo(staker) != 0,
and isDelegated(staker) == true (redundant with above)
-only allowed when calling `delegateTo` or `delegateToBySignature`

2)
FROM not delegated AND not registered as an operator
TO an operator
in this case, the end state is that:
isOperator(staker) == true,
delegatedTo(staker) == staker,
and isDelegated(staker) == true (redundant with above)
-only allowed when calling `registerAsOperator`

3)
FROM not registered as an operator AND delegated
TO not delegated (and still *not* registered as an operator)
in this case, the end state is that:
isOperator(staker) == false,
delegatedTo(staker) == 0,
and isDelegated(staker) == false (redundant with above)

ILLEGAL STATE TRANSITIONS:
A)
FROM registered as an operator
TO not registered as an operator

B) 
FROM registered as an operator (implies they are also delegated to themselves)
TO not delegated to themselves

C)
FROM delegated to an operator
TO delegated to another operator
(without undelegating in-between)

FORBIDDEN STATES:
-an address cannot be simultaneously (classified as an operator) and (not delegated to themselves)
-an address cannot be (delegated to themselves) and (not classified as an operator)
Combining the above, an address can be (classified as an operator) *iff* they are (delegated to themselves).
The exception is the zero address, since by default an address is 'delegated to the zero address' when they are not delegated at all
