## Highlights

üêõ *Bug Fixes*
- Update the `EigenPod.requestWithdrawal` function to ensure that validators are pointed to the pod, matching the behavior of `requestConsolidation`

üîß *Improvements*
- Update the `EigenPod.verifyWithdrawalCredentials` function to only accept `beaconTimestamps` that are after the `latestCheckpointTimestamp`. This enables the eigenpod state machine to be easier to be reasoned about
