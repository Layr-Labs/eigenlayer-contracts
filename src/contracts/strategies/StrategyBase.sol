/**
 * @title Base implementation of `IStrategy` interface, designed to be inherited from by more complex strategies.
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice Simple, basic, "do-nothing" Strategy that holds a single underlying token and returns it on withdrawals.
 * Implements minimal versions of the IStrategy functions, this contract is designed to be inherited by
 * more complex strategies, which can then override its functions as necessary.
 * @dev Note that some functions have their mutability restricted; developers inheriting from this contract cannot broaden
 * the mutability without modifying this contract itself.
 * @dev This contract is expressly *not* intended for use with 'fee-on-transfer'-type tokens.
 * Setting the `underlyingToken` to be a fee-on-transfer token may result in improper accounting.
 * @notice This contract functions similarly to an ERC4626 vault, only without issuing a token.
 * To mitigate against the common "inflation attack" vector, we have chosen to use the 'virtual shares' mitigation route,
 * similar to [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol).
 * We acknowledge that this mitigation has the known downside of the virtual shares causing some losses to users, which are pronounced
 * particularly in the case of the share exchange rate changing signficantly, either positively or negatively.
 * For a fairly thorough discussion of this issue and our chosen mitigation strategy, we recommend reading through
 * [this thread](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3706) on the OpenZeppelin repo.
 * We specifically use a share offset of `SHARES_OFFSET` and a balance offset of `BALANCE_OFFSET`.
