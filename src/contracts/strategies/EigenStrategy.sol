/**
 * @title Eigen Strategy implementation of `IStrategy` interface, designed to be inherited from by more complex strategies.
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @dev Note that this EigenStrategy contract is designed to be compatible with both bEIGEN and EIGEN tokens. It functions exactly the same
 * as the `StrategyBase` contract if bEIGEN were the underlying token, but also allows for depositing and withdrawing EIGEN tokens. This is
 * achieved by unwrapping EIGEN into bEIGEN upon deposit, and wrapping bEIGEN into EIGEN upon withdrawal. Deposits and withdrawals with bEIGEN
 * does not perform and wrapping or unwrapping.
 * @notice This contract functions similarly to an ERC4626 vault, only without issuing a token.
 * To mitigate against the common "inflation attack" vector, we have chosen to use the 'virtual shares' mitigation route,
 * similar to [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol).
 * We acknowledge that this mitigation has the known downside of the virtual shares causing some losses to users, which are pronounced
 * particularly in the case of the share exchange rate changing signficantly, either positively or negatively.
 * For a fairly thorough discussion of this issue and our chosen mitigation strategy, we recommend reading through
 * [this thread](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3706) on the OpenZeppelin repo.
 * We specifically use a share offset of `SHARES_OFFSET` and a balance offset of `BALANCE_OFFSET`.
