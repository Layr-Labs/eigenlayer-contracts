 * @title DelegationManager
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice  This is the contract for delegation in EigenLayer. The main functionalities of this contract are
 * - enabling anyone to register as an operator in EigenLayer
 * - allowing operators to specify parameters related to stakers who delegate to them
 * - enabling any staker to delegate its stake to the operator of its choice (a given staker can only delegate to a single operator at a time)
 * - enabling a staker to undelegate its assets from the operator it is delegated to (performed as part of the withdrawal process, initiated through the StrategyManager)
