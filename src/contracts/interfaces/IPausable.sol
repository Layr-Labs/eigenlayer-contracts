/**
 * @title Adds pausability to a contract, with pausing & unpausing controlled by the `pauser` and `unpauser` of a PauserRegistry contract.
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice Contracts that inherit from this contract may define their own `pause` and `unpause` (and/or related) functions.
 * These functions should be permissioned as "onlyPauser" which defers to a `PauserRegistry` for determining access control.
 * @dev Pausability is implemented using a uint256, which allows up to 256 different single bit-flags; each bit can potentially pause different functionality.
 * Inspiration for this was taken from the NearBridge design here https://etherscan.io/address/0x3FEFc5A4B1c02f21cBc8D3613643ba0635b9a873#code.
 * For the `pause` and `unpause` functions we've implemented, if you pause, you can only flip (any number of) switches to on/1 (aka "paused"), and if you unpause,
 * you can only flip (any number of) switches to off/0 (aka "paused").
 * If you want a pauseXYZ function that just flips a single bit / "pausing flag", it will:
 * 1) 'bit-wise and' (aka `&`) a flag with the current paused state (as a uint256)
 * 2) update the paused state to this new value
 * @dev We note as well that we have chosen to identify flags by their *bit index* as opposed to their numerical value, so, e.g. defining `DEPOSITS_PAUSED = 3`
 * indicates specifically that if the *third bit* of `_paused` is flipped -- i.e. it is a '1' -- then deposits should be paused
