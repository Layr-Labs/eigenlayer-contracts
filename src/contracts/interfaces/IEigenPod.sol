/**
 * @title The implementation contract used for restaking beacon chain ETH on EigenLayer 
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice The main functionalities are:
 * - creating new ETH validators with their withdrawal credentials pointed to this contract
 * - proving from beacon chain state roots that withdrawal credentials are pointed to this contract
 * - proving from beacon chain state roots the balances of ETH validators with their withdrawal credentials
 *   pointed to this contract
 * - updating aggregate balances in the EigenPodManager
 * - withdrawing eth when withdrawals are initiated
 * @dev Note that all beacon chain balances are stored as gwei within the beacon chain datastructures. We choose
 *   to account balances in terms of gwei in the EigenPod contract and convert to wei when making calls to other contracts
