 * @title Interface for a middleware / service that may look at past stake amounts.
 * @author Layr Labs, Inc.
 * @notice Terms of Service: https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/overview/terms-of-service
 * @notice Specifically, this interface is designed for services that consult stake amounts up to `BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE`
 * blocks in the past. This may be necessary due to, e.g., network processing & communication delays, or to avoid race conditions
 * that could be present with coordinating aggregate operator signatures while service operators are registering & de-registering.
 * @dev To clarify edge cases, the middleware can look `BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE` blocks into the past, i.e. it may trust stakes from the interval
 * [block.number - BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE, block.number] (specifically, *inclusive* of the block that is `BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE` before the current one)
 */
