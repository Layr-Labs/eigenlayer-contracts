    ///    a. AllocationManager.createOperatorSet: Creates an operatorSet
    ///    b. KeyRegistrar.configureOperatorSet: Configures the curve type of the operatorSet
    ///    c. CrossChainRegistry.makeGenerationReservation: Registers the operatorSet to be transported by the multichain protocol. This includes
    ///      the `owner`, `maxStalenessPeriod`, and `operatorTableCalculator` for the operatorSet. The output of the `OperatorTableCalculator`
    ///      are the operatorSet's stake weights (i.e. operator table) and is transported by the multichain protocol, along with the `maxStalenessPeriod` and `owner`
    /// 2. The multichain protocol calculates the operatorTable of an operatorSet. The time at which the table is calculated is the reference timesetamp. The protocol
    ///    will then call `updateOperatorTable` to update the operatorSet's operator table for a given referenceTimestamp
    /// 3. A task is created and certificate is generated, off-chain, by the AVS to validate the completion of a task.
    ///    The reference timestamp in the certificate is used to key into the operator table that was updated in step 2.
    /// 4. The certificate is verified, either normally, proportionally, or nominally.
    /// @dev The `referenceTimestamp` is used to key into the operatorSet's stake weights. It is NOT when the certificate was generated off-chain
    /// @dev The `maxStalenessPeriod` configured in step 1c denotes if a certificate is too stale with respect to the `referenceTimestamp`
    /// @dev Operator tables for ALL operatorSets with an active generation reservation are updated at a set cadence. See `crossChainRegistry.tableUpdateCadence` for the frequency of table updates
    /// @dev To ensure that tables do not become stale between table updates (i.e. a large operator has joined or been ejected), the multichain protocol updates tables for operatorSets when the following events are emitted:
    ///      - AllocationManager: `OperatorSlashed`
    ///      - AllocationManager: `OperatorAddedToOperatorSet`
    ///      - AllocationManager: `OperatorRemovedFromOperatorSet`
    /// @dev Certificates can be replayed across all destination chains
    /// @dev Race conditions should be handled by the AVS. The protocol makes no guarantees about how certificates should be verified (eg. preventing certificates against tables that are NOT the latest)
    ///      Some examples of race conditions include:
    ///      a. An in-flight certificate for a past reference timestamp and an operator table update for a newer reference timestamp. The AVS should decide whether it
    ///         wants to only confirm tasks against the *latest* certificate
    ///      b. An in-flight certificate against a stake table with a majority-stake operator that has been slashed or removed from the operatorSet
