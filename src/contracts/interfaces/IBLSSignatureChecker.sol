     * @notice This function is called by disperser when it has aggregated all the signatures of the operators
     * that are part of the quorum for a particular taskNumber and is asserting them into onchain. The function
     * checks that the claim for aggregated signatures are valid.
     *
     * The thesis of this procedure entails:
     * - getting the aggregated pubkey of all registered nodes at the time of pre-commit by the
     * disperser (represented by apk in the parameters),
     * - subtracting the pubkeys of all the signers not in the quorum (nonSignerPubkeys) and storing 
     * the output in apk to get aggregated pubkey of all operators that are part of quorum.
     * - use this aggregated pubkey to verify the aggregated signature under BLS scheme.
     * 
     * @dev Before signature verification, the function verifies operator stake information.  This includes ensuring that the provided `referenceBlockNumber`
     * is correct, i.e., ensure that the stake returned from the specified block number is recent enough and that the stake is either the most recent update
     * for the total stake (or the operator) or latest before the referenceBlockNumber.
