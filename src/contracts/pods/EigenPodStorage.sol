    /// For example:
    /// 1. Consider a validator was last checkpointed at 32 ETH before exiting. Once the exit has been processed,
    /// it is expected that the validator's exited balance is calculated to be `32 ETH`.
    /// 2. However, before `startCheckpoint` is called, a deposit is made to the validator for 1 ETH. The beacon
    /// chain will automatically withdraw this ETH, but not until the withdrawal sweep passes over the validator
    /// again. Until this occurs, the validator's current balance (used for checkpointing) is 1 ETH.
    /// 3. If `startCheckpoint` is called at this point, the balance delta calculated for this validator will be
    /// `-31 ETH`, and because the validator has a nonzero balance, it is not marked WITHDRAWN.
    /// 4. After the exit is processed by the beacon chain, a subsequent `startCheckpoint` and checkpoint proof
    /// will calculate a balance delta of `-1 ETH` and attribute a 1 ETH exit to the validator.
    ///
    /// If this edge case impacts your usecase, it should be possible to mitigate this by monitoring for deposits
    /// to your exited validators, and waiting to call `startCheckpoint` until those deposits have been automatically
    /// exited.
    ///

    /// - If a validator is slashed, their balance exited will reflect their original balance rather than the slashed amount
    /// - The final partial withdrawal for an exited validator will be likely be included in this mapping.

    ///   "exited" amount to be 32.1 ETH rather than 32 ETH.
