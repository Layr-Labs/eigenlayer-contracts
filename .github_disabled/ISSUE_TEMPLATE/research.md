## Description
Add a summary and description. What do we need any why? Any preliminary notion of options + what we want out of them?

### Action Items
- [ ] Create a list of options to evaluate
- [ ] Do research, summarize findings into a doc or here
- [ ] Present research, discuss next steps
- [ ] Write up next steps + create new issue(s) for them

### Blocking Issues
Is anything blocking for this? (Should we make another decision or scope something first?)
Please link blocking issues here. If something is blocking and doesn't have an issue yet, create it!

### Don't Forget To
* Assign this to a project (our default is [eigenlayer](https://github.com/orgs/Layr-Labs/projects/3/))
* Add priority + size estimate
* Set status to New
